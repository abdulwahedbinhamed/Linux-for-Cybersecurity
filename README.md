# Linux Commands for Cybersecurity 🐧💻

This repository contains a curated list of essential Linux commands and terminal utilities I'm learning and using as part of my cybersecurity journey.

As a Computer Science Engineering student focused on ethical hacking and network security, mastering Linux is crucial. These notes and references help me work confidently in lab environments, penetration testing platforms, and real-world scenarios.

## 📂 What's Included

- Common file system commands (`ls`, `cd`, `cat`, etc.)
- User & permission management (`chmod`, `chown`, `sudo`, etc.)
- Networking tools (`ifconfig`, `netstat`, `ping`, `nmap`, etc.)
- Process & service control (`ps`, `kill`, `systemctl`)
- Package management (apt, yum, etc.)
- Bash scripting basics

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Linux is the backbone of most cybersecurity labs, tools, and servers. Whether working with Kali Linux, cloud-based terminals, or self-hosted labs, this knowledge is a must-have.

## 🚀 Current Learning Path

- Linux fundamentals from TryHackMe
- Real-world practice through CTFs and labs
- Supporting my ethical hacking and Python security scripting

## 🛡️ Note

These commands are for **educational and ethical learning** only. Always use terminal access responsibly and within authorized environments.
